- Created third mini=game;
- Second phase of gameplay testing

## Journey

- Challenges
  - Working with multiple clients, debugging was quite a challenge sinice it was my first big networked project.
  - Creating diegetic interactions that are intuitive thorughout the experience was a bit challegning and multiple tests were needed.
- Solutions
  - Designed the system architecture before programming anything.
  - Tested almost every changed made throughout the project with people avaliable around me.
  - Had a solid User flow and vision for what I wanted to create.
- What I learned?
  - Create System Architectures to help scalate projects more easily.
  - How to do multiple clients debugging and testing with efficiency.
